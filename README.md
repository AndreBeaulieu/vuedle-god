This is a recreation / reimagining of Doodle God (2010) by JoyBits for Adobe Flash.
Simply click on two elements to combine them. Your goal is to create them all. You start with only 4, but will eventually create 36.
Many elements and combinations have been changed from the original game.
Consult the tutorial if you get stuck!
